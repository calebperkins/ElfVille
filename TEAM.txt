=====================

I made the first prototype of the Client and devised the overall architecture, which was later improved upon by Aaron. I created a Socket Controller to handle network communication for the Client. I created the Welcome Screen to handle registration and login, the Create Post screen Central Board. Time taken: 12 hours

I helped devise the communication protocol between the Client and Server. On the Server side, I refactored the database code to use more efficient / thread-safe data structures. I also implemented the database backup/restore mechanism. I also wrote the README.txt. Time taken: 12 hours
