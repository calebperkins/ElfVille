=====================

I made the first prototype of the Client and devised the overall architecture, which was later improved upon by Aaron. I created a Socket Controller to handle network communication for the Client. I created the Welcome Screen to handle registration and login, the Create Post screen Central Board. Time taken: 12 hours

I helped devise the communication protocol between the Client and Server. On the Server side, I refactored the database code to use more efficient / thread-safe data structures. I also implemented the database backup/restore mechanism. I also wrote the README.txt. Time taken: 12 hours

==============

I implemented the entirety of the controller, except for the method getClanBoard. The controller is the core of the server, parsing the requests sent by clients, determining how to respond to them, and generating responses by querying the server.  In the process of doing this, I also modified the database occasionally and filled out much of the protocol.  As the largest part of what I did, this took about 17 hours.

I fixed most of the bugs found by users of the client, and wrote some test classes to fit in Paul's JUnit testing framework.  Specifically, I worked on ClanDirectoryTest, ClanBoardTest, and WelcomeScreenTest.  This took about 7 hours.
